# Guessing Game

## Description:
This is a simple number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player has 5 attempts to guess the number correctly. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the number is smaller or larger than the guess. If the player guesses the number correctly, they win; otherwise, they lose after all attempts are used.

## Features:
- The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player has 5 attempts to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game tells the player whether the number is higher or lower than their guess.
- If the player guesses the number correctly, they win, and the game displays a congratulatory message.
- If the player runs out of attempts without guessing the number, the game displays the correct number, and the player loses.

## How to Run:
1. Make sure you have the .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK installed on your system.
2. Create a new C# console project or use an existing one.
3. Copy and paste the code into your project's main class.
4. Run the application from your IDE or terminal.

## Game Flow:
1. The game starts by generating a random number.
2. The player is prompted to enter a guess.
3. The game compares the guess to the random number and provides feedback.
4. The player continues guessing until they either guess the correct number or exhaust their attempts.
5. At the end of the game, the result (win or lose) is displayed along with the number the player was trying to guess.

## Example:
```yaml
Welcome to the Guessing Game!
I thought of a number between 1 and 100. You have 5 attempts to guess it.

Remaining attempts: 5
Enter your guess: 50
The number is larger.

Remaining attempts: 4
Enter your guess: 75
The number is smaller.

Remaining attempts: 3
Enter your guess: 60
The number is smaller.

Remaining attempts: 2
Enter your guess: 55
The number is smaller.

Remaining attempts: 1
Enter your guess: 52
Congratulations! You guessed the number!
```

## Requirements:
- .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK
- A C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code)
